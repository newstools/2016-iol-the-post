Durban - Sundresh Prakash Sewpujun would have turned 47 on Wednesday, but instead of celebrating his birthday, his family is mourning his death.Sewpujun, the owner of Akha-Nathi Waterproofing, was stabbed in the chest, allegedly by someone he knew, in Pinetown on Saturday morning. He died soon afterwards at The Crompton Hospital.His wife Sharlaine said her husband worked mainly in Durban, and because of the distance he stayed with family in Reservoir Hills and would return to his home in Belfort, Pietermaritzburg, when he was not busy. &quot;On the day of the attack he picked up his workers and headed to the construction site in Pinetown. &quot;According to the workers, he got into an argument with (a man) over work that was not complete. The (man) then stormed off the site, only to return later with a knife to stab him.&quot; She said the assailant fled the scene.&quot;Prakash got into his vehicle and started to drive to The Crompton Hospital, some of the workers went with him. While driving he collapsed and another worker took over.&quot; Sharlaine said one of the employees called her to tell her what had happened.&quot;I was shattered and completely broke down. I rushed to the hospital but he died before we got there.&quot; She described the father of three as a generous, simple man who loved to help others.&quot;He would have turned 47 on Wednesday and on his birthday he always spoilt us. &quot;My husband came from a humble background and he worked very hard to establish his business. He always believed in helping people and giving them chances.&quot; She said in July he opened a multi-skilling centre aimed at providing skills for out-of-work hostel dwellers in KwaMashu.&quot;He was so excited about the project. He knew it was going to help many people in that community.&quot;Breaking down in tears, Sharlaine said what happened to him was unfair and she hoped to get justice for his death.While she and her children are trying to come to grips with their loss, police are hunting for the suspect, who is now believed to have fled to Lesotho.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was being investigated by Pinetown SAPS, and anyone with information that could lead to an arrest should call 031 325 5079.POST
